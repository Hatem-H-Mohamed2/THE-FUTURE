          Alan Turing changed history for the second time with a simple question: "Can machines think?" Less than a decade after breaking the Nazi encryption machine Enigma and helping the Allies win World War II, mathematician Alan Turing changed history once more with a simple question: "Can machines think?"

        <p>
          The core purpose and vision of artificial intelligence were set by Turing's paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) and the Turing Test that followed.

          At its most basic level, AI is a discipline of computer science whose goal is to answer yes to Turing's question. It is the goal of artificial intelligence researchers to reproduce or duplicate human intellect in robots.

          Artificial intelligence's broad purpose has sparked a slew of questions and arguments. So much so that there is no commonly acknowledged definition of the field.

        <br>

          The biggest flaw in just defining AI as "creating intelligent machines" is that it fails to describe what artificial intelligence is. What distinguishes a machine as intelligent?

          Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig addressed the subject in their pioneering textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by uniting their work around the idea of intelligent agents in machines. AI is defined as "the study of agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions," according to this definition. (Russel and Norvig viii)
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Norvig and Russell then go on to look at four main approaches to AI that have shaped the discipline in the past:
