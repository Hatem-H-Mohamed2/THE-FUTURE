        <p class="pp">Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Narrow AI: This type of artificial intelligence, often known as "weak AI," operates in a constrained context and is an imitation of human intelligence. While narrow AI is frequently focused on executing a specific task very well, these machines operate under many more constraints and limits than even the most basic human intelligence.
          <br>
          <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): AGI, often known as "Strong AI," is the type of artificial intelligence we see in movies like Westworld's machines or Star Trek: The Next Generation's Data. AGI is a machine that has general intelligence and can use that intelligence to solve any problem, much like a person can. </li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="h33">Narrow Artificial Intelligence</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Narrow AI is all around us, and it is by far the most successful implementation of AI to far. According to "Preparing for the Future of Artificial Intelligence," a 2016 report released by the Obama Administration, Narrow AI has had major advancements in the recent decade that have had "substantial societal advantages and have contributed to the economic vitality of the nation." 
        </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3 class="hhh3">Artificial General Intelligence</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          For many AI researchers, the creation of a machine with human-level intellect that can be applied to any activity is the Holy Grail, yet the road to AGI has proven difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          The search for a "universal algorithm for learning and acting in any environment" (Russel and Norvig 27) isn't new, but the difficulties of constructing a machine with a complete set of cognitive abilities hasn't become any easier. 
        </p>
        <p>
          AGI has long been the subject of dystopian science fiction, in which super-intelligent robots take over humans, but scientists believe that it isn't something we should be concerned about anytime soon.
